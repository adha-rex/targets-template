# Targets pipeline v0.1.4

This project is a targets pipeline. It was made using a [template](https://github.com/adha-rex/targets-template).
The template can be loaded using the following code:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("https://tinyurl.com/get-project")
get_project(
  project_dir = "YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_DIR", # includes project name and doesn't currently exist i.e. "Projects/mhr-pathology-pipeline"
  repo = "targets-template" # can be a repo of adha-rex's or a {OWNER/REPO} format to use anyone's versioned repo
)
```

To get started with the new project and add it to GitHub, open the project and run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)
```
